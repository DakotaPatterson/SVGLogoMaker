# SVGLogoMaker

 ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description
  This project is a Logo Generator that uses the user input to generate a logo using node.js and svg. My motivation was to make an application that allowed users to create a logo for any project that they are working on. This application allows the user to input all the information about their logo using node.js and then a file is saved under the logo.svg. I have learned that node.js is useful to help users and developers to have a more streamlined development experience and allow for user input in the creation of applications.
